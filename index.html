        <h2>Philosophy of Prayer</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Attitude of prayer</dt>
          <dd class="indent">Simone Weil mentions that prayer requires attention or focus. I agree with the idea that
            prayer requires a focus not because God won’t hear us but that we might not hear God if we don’t focus on
            what we are saying and feeling. Prayer for me is most effective when I’m alone and in a quiet place that is
            free from distractions. I try and treat it as a conversation, and I know that majority of the time I’ll have
            to do a lot of the talking. I share what is going on as if God knew nothing about my life. It helps me to
            freely discuss what is going on and what my worries are. I try to treat the prayer as if it was between me
            and a parent or someone who loves me. I find these prayers leave me feeling more peaceful.
          </dd>
          <dt>What prayer can do</dt>
          <dd class="indent">Prayer can lead to miracles. I know no other way of putting it. Those miracles can be
            diverse things including healing, blessings, help, and change. In the movie Shadowlands, C.S Lewis mentions
            that prayer might not change anything that is going on in our lives but through prayer, God can change us.
            On my mission, I had a rough time a couple of weeks into Covid. Nothing was going the way I hoped it would.
            I started to pray while writing in my journal about what was going on in my life. I expressed how angry,
            frustrated, and helpless I felt. At the end of that prayer, I had received some knowledge that I wasn’t
            expecting. God didn’t justify how I felt instead he showed me things that I could not see at the time.
            Nothing changed about the situation I was in, but I made it past day 24 of being confined to an apartment
            and made it to the 9-month mark. Nothing had astronomically changed about my situation it still sucked but I
            was changed which made something more possible.
          </dd>
          <dt>Why I pray</dt>
          <dd class="indent"> C.S Lewis shares “He gave us small creatures the dignity of being able to contribute to
            the course of events in two different ways”. He explains that one of these ways is through prayer. I’ve seen
            this demonstrated when I’ve knelt on my knees during difficult moments and prayed for relief and been given
            the capacity to be cleaned of the worries of what I was struggling through. I pray because I know that I can
            learn about God. He teaches me as I communicate with him showing me things that I never would have been able
            to acknowledge without him. The main reason I pray might be more towards the pragmatist side. I pray because
            I’ve experienced it working in my own life and so I continue to do so.

        <h2>Acknowledging Difficulties</h2>

        <p class="indent"> In a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, Mr. Rogers explains that talking about something
          makes
          it a human
          problem. When something is a human problem, it becomes manageable. In my relationships, I’ve seen problems
          arise because something couldn’t be discussed. Someone was hurting and neither of us could help the other
          because we didn’t know how to talk about it and when we tried, we never managed to get to the heart of what
          was going on. I’ve found that I need to discuss challenging things when they arise. I feel morally obligated
          to do so because I’ve seen how much different life can be when we struggle through things together instead of
          being alone. In the Shadowlands, Joy discusses with C.S Lewis that her death they need to talk about. She
          explains that it will help both to enjoy what is going on know if they acknowledge the suffering that is to
          come. The scriptures teach us that we need to mourn with those that mourn and I think this principle starts
          with being able to talk about difficult topics. </p>
