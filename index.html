        <h2>Philosophy of Prayer</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Attitude of prayer</dt>
          <dd class="indent">Simone Weil mentions that prayer requires attention or focus. I agree with the idea that
            prayer requires a focus not because God won’t hear us but that we might not hear God if we don’t focus on
            what we are saying and feeling. Prayer for me is most effective when I’m alone and in a quiet place that is
            free from distractions. I try and treat it as a conversation, and I know that majority of the time I’ll have
            to do a lot of the talking. I share what is going on as if God knew nothing about my life. It helps me to
            freely discuss what is going on and what my worries are. I try to treat the prayer as if it was between me
            and a parent or someone who loves me. I find these prayers leave me feeling more peaceful.
          </dd>
          <dt>What prayer can do</dt>
          <dd class="indent">Prayer can lead to miracles. I know no other way of putting it. Those miracles can be
            diverse things including healing, blessings, help, and change. In the movie Shadowlands, C.S Lewis mentions
            that prayer might not change anything that is going on in our lives but through prayer, God can change us.
            On my mission, I had a rough time a couple of weeks into Covid. Nothing was going the way I hoped it would.
            I started to pray while writing in my journal about what was going on in my life. I expressed how angry,
            frustrated, and helpless I felt. At the end of that prayer, I had received some knowledge that I wasn’t
            expecting. God didn’t justify how I felt instead he showed me things that I could not see at the time.
            Nothing changed about the situation I was in, but I made it past day 24 of being confined to an apartment
            and made it to the 9-month mark. Nothing had astronomically changed about my situation it still sucked but I
            was changed which made something more possible.
          </dd>
          <dt>Why I pray</dt>
          <dd class="indent"> C.S Lewis shares “He gave us small creatures the dignity of being able to contribute to
            the course of events in two different ways”. He explains that one of these ways is through prayer. I’ve seen
            this demonstrated when I’ve knelt on my knees during difficult moments and prayed for relief and been given
            the capacity to be cleaned of the worries of what I was struggling through. I pray because I know that I can
            learn about God. He teaches me as I communicate with him showing me things that I never would have been able
            to acknowledge without him. The main reason I pray might be more towards the pragmatist side. I pray because
            I’ve experienced it working in my own life and so I continue to do so.

        <h2>Acknowledging Difficulties</h2>

        <p class="indent">In a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, Mr. Rogers explains that talking about something makes
          it a human problem. When something is a human problem, it becomes manageable. In my relationships, I’ve seen
          problems arise because something couldn’t be discussed. Someone was hurting and neither of us could help the
          other because we didn’t know how to talk about it and when we tried, we never managed to get to the heart of
          what was going on. I’ve found that I need to discuss challenging things when they arise. I feel morally
          obligated to do so because I’ve seen how much different life can be when we struggle through things together
          instead of being alone. In the Shadowlands, Joy discusses with C.S Lewis that her death they need to talk
          about. She explains that it will help both to enjoy what is going on know if they acknowledge the suffering
          that is to come. The scriptures teach us that we need to mourn with those that mourn, and I think this
          principle starts with being able to talk about difficult topics. </p>

        <h2>Truth</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Imbalances in Truth</dt>
          <dd class="indent">The Apology by Plato describes a cave in which a group is trapped and living in a small
            world oblivious to
            the opportunities around them. One moral of the story is that not everyone wants to change and not everyone
            has access to the truth that is out there. I believe that the imbalances of truth that occur shouldn’t be
            fixed against the will of those around us. We can’t force anyone to leave the cave. We need to live in a way
            where others might want to change and seek the information for themselves. We can even invite people to
            listen to what we have to say but we can’t force the information on those around us. In Theaetetus by Plato,
            a story is told of Socrates’ quest to enlighten everyone around him that they don’t know what they think
            they know. I don’t believe in this story Socrates went about his goal in the right way. In the end, he was
            sentenced to death because he was disturbing people and refusing to back down. His goal might have been good
            but how he was trying to accomplish it led him to be incapable of continuing.

          </dd>
          <dt>Sources of Truth</dt>
          <dd class="indent">Chauncey C. Riddle in his essay Ways of Knowing discusses his thoughts on sources of
            knowledge. At the end
            of his essay, he writes about personal revelation. He says, “A wise Latter-day Saint will know and use all
            of the epistemologies, employing each where most needed and most valuable”. I agree with Chauncey in the
            fact that we need to not rely only on one source of knowledge. God has given the world so many ways to learn
            and grow. Each epistemology can help someone learn things that he wouldn’t have been able to learn using
            another epistemology. There are even some people who have preferences in their ways of learning. My favorite
            epistemology is probably technology as it requires me to learn how things work and why they work the way
            they do.
          </dd>
          <dt>Relative Truth</dt>
          <dd class="indent">In the autobiography of Gandhi, there’s an idea discussed relative truth. He says, “as long
            as I have not
            realized this Absolute Truth, so long must I hold by the relative truth as I have conceived it”. He
            describes that he can only see glimpses of the Absolute Truth and since he can’t see the full picture, he
            must rely on what he does know or what he does understand. This is very important in my life because it
            helps me to admit that I don’t know everything, but I can move forward with the things that I do know. Life
            is all about seeking for and finding truth and I know that we will only get a little here and a little
            there. The bible teaches that we will learn here a little there a little grace by grace. This should also
            help me to be humble because I know that there is more for me to learn. If I want to receive more, then
            admitting that there is more to receive is one of the first steps.

        <h2>Ethics of Change</h2>

        <p class="indent">
          Gandhi the movie showed how Gandhi went about making change happen in South Africa and India. He focused on
          specific attainable goals and showed his support for people who were oppressed. I think this was a great way
          of going about change. Gandhi was willing to accept the consequences of breaking laws and wasn’t trying to
          avoid the punishments that the law would give. He didn’t create hate, but he would not tolerate hate from
          others. He fought their hate in peaceful ways. If change is to be brought about it should be done in ways that
          show how much you care about the people. It needs to be done in ways that fight the specific problem that you
          see but you also must accept the consequences of your actions. Gandhi made the decisions he did to establish
          change because the goal wasn’t only to change the government but to change the people themselves. His goal was
          to create a society that could follow through with the changes he sought in government. Change means little if
          that change isn’t followed through and defended.

          <dt>Self-Care</dt>
          <dd class="indent">Marcus Aurelius expresses the idea that all men are linked together and that to act against
            another person
            is contrary to nature. I believe that being a good neighbor entails looking out for one another and treating
            each other with mutual respect. I know that when I’m upset with someone that generally hurts my relationship
            with myself. Aurelius also mentions the idea that Good and bad things happen to everyone. This helps me to
            see that we shouldn’t judge people on what they are going through. We shouldn’t leave someone behind just
            because they live a different life than us. We shouldn’t let the past of those we spend time with stop us
            from being their friend. We do need to worry about how they act currently, but we need to allow people the
            opportunity to change. Aurelius believed that “There is only one fruit of this terrene life, a pious
            disposition and social acts”. This has a huge part in the purpose of life. Being a good neighbor is
            extremely important to who we become as we learn to look outside of ourselves. Mr. Rogers as previously
            mentioned thinks we need to mourn with those around us to walk with the people who are nearby. Being a good
            neighbor helps me to see how God treats his other children. It also allows me to ask God how he would like
            me to treat his children. Gandhi stated in his Autobiography that salvation could only come to those who put
            others before themselves in all scenarios. Putting others first requires a lot of effort in our day-to-day
            lives, but it is necessary because this life isn’t just about us.
